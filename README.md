Writing about intangible human features (such as emotions) and treating them like physical objects.


Alchemy is an ideology that originated in the middle ages. It studied a seemingly magical transformation of the elements. It was a precursor to the current science of Chemistry which feeds into and relates to Physics and Biology. The title of this book, “Persuasion Alchemy” considers an idea that human motivation is an alchemical process. The author believes that many of us sense this phenomenon to some extent. 

This Book Is Not Based On “The Law of Attraction”
There are a lot of people since the middle ages who have described processes that seem to utilize the ideas of alchemy. The most popular being the “Law of Attraction”. This book is not based on the popular “law of attraction”. The law of attraction has taken the modern world by storm with it’s ideas that one can control the natural world with the psychic realm. In other words, the belief of the “law of attraction” is the idea that thoughts control things. The belief system is that everything in your life, you have attracted into your life, by your thoughts. 

The Weakness in the “Law of Attraction”
The author believes that the law of attraction has a major flaw. That being that it leaves the student with many questions about “how” this transmutation occurs of thoughts and ideas into physical reality. It has few rules that actually give practitioners direction to the manifestation of what it is they truly desire. In this way, it is not a science.

What is a Science?
For a subject of study to be considered scientific, it must possess a certain predictive nature. Scientists observe the phenomena of nature and try to find patterns and principles that describe their relationship. When one studies the Newtonian law that says Force is mass times acceleration (F = ma), one can draw conclusions form it. One such conclusion is that when I increase the mass of an object, the force it exerts (in a collision or reaction of some sort) increases. Another conclusion from the same equation is that even with a small mass, I can exert a great force if I increase the acceleration of the body. This conclusions can be tested in real life and demonstrated in nature.

What is Persuasion Alchemy?
Persuasion Alchemy differs from the law of attraction and all other pseudoscientific ideas of how the world works, because it is based on proven scientific laws. This book, and other books in this series will use scientific laws from the physical sciences to demonstrate the mechanisms of human behavior, motivation and persuasion. It, like in the sciences, asks appropriate questions of our world, designs observational experiments to try to answer these questions and draws appropriate conclusions from the results.

In this book, the experiments will be observational in nature and we will be observing and exploring the lives of public figures. We will deconstruct matters of love, the will, relationship dynamics and so much more with real life examples. For example, Persuasion Alchemy will take a Physics Equation such as Force = mass x acceleration and demonstrate how the “force” of Justin Beiber becoming famous is produced by a critical “mass” of a combination of elements accelerating in a vectorally significant direction. Examples will be given in the lives of various public figures about how exactly this process takes place.

The purpose of this first book that you are reading now is to introduce you to fundamental concepts of persuasion alchemy. As we progress in our study, we will delve deeper. We start in this book by establishing our units and physical quantities, and then we progress to One Dimensional Motion in Relationships. In this book, we stop at an introduction to Newtonian Laws. In future books, we will progress to higher concepts such as electricity, magnetism, heat, waves and even quantum mechanics.

If you are a lover of science, a pop culture fanatic, a student of psychology or just another person seeking to gain insight into your own life, this book (and consequential series) is a MUST READ.
