What is One-Dimensional Motion?
In Physics, we study the interaction of various masses, and thus forces, interacting in different ways. In this introductory chapter of this introductory book, we will try to understand better the ways forces interact in general, by considering the simplest possible example of such a situation. This means two things:
Only one mass/force/body will be involved (meaning it will not be interacting with any other bodies).
The mass will only be moving in one direction (as opposed to changing directions).

For this reasons, such effects and forces such as “friction” will not play any role. 

Displacement, Time and Average Velocity of LOVE
In starting with One-Dimensional Motion, let us take the ever popular concept of romantic love. Suppose the man’s desire for the woman is moving along a straight track. We will learn in later considerations that this desire may be driven from inside the man or from outside the man, but for now, let us just take it that the man is being driven to desire a woman. To study the motion of his desire, we treat his desires as a particle. We also need a coordinate system. 

Let us choose the x-axis (on a Cartesian plane) to lie along the lover’s straight-line path with the origin at 0 at the starting line. The “origin” (or zero point) symbolizes that point where the man’s level of interest in the woman results in a change of interest. As we mentioned in the study of “vectors”, that zero point is a choice made by the observer. We also choose the direction of the front end of the man’s desire “particle”.

We learned in the previous chapter that an essential unit in the study of Physics and in our study is “time”. So, in order to understand what this man’s desire particle is doing, we are going to consider the change in this particle’s position over a period of time.

Suppose that 2.0s  after the start of a particular event, the front of the desire particle is at point P1, 19 mm from the origin, and 4.0s after the start it is at point P2, 27 mm from the origin. The displacement of the particle is a vector that points from P1 to P2. Figure 2.1 shows that the vector points along the x-axis. The x-component of the vector is just the change in the value of x, (27mm - 19mm)= 8 mm, that took place during the interval of (4.0s - 2.0s) = 2.0s. The average velocity of the lover’s desire during this time interval is defined as a vector quantity whose x-component is the change in x divided by the time interval: (8 mm)/(2.0s) = 4 mm/s.

From this, we can state that this man’s desire for this woman is moving at a rate of 4 mm/s. However, this leaves us with a question. What is it moving towards, why is it moving and are millimeters appropriate units for measuring the distance traveled by his love? Let’s tackle these questions one at a time:

What is the man’s LOVE moving towards?
In this scenario, the man’s love is moving towards (or away from) the woman’s (or the man’s) “sphere of influence”. His love will have to overcome man material and spiritual barriers before it can cause either of them to take action. We will address these in our discussions on force and it’s derivatives. In this situation, his love is only moving. We have not discussed why it is moving, only that it is moving, in what direction and how fast.

Why is LOVE moving?
In this thought experiment, because we are treating love as a material object, it must move. In order to talk about why it is moving, we must talk about what moved it. I’m choosing love, because it is one of our fundamental motivations. In persuasion alchemy, we are dealing with things that cause people to act and react. Things that set people (as opposed to inanimate objects) in motion. Things that influence a person’s will. LOVE is not only a component of one’s will, but also influences the will, and is influenced by the will of the person and others. That influences causes a motion. The direction of the motion is determined by the observer. This brings us to our next question.

Are millimeters appropriate units for measuring the distance traveled by LOVE?
The short answer to this question is that ‘I am not yet certain’. This thought experiment has only just begun. I must confess that I have not spent enough time considering the appropriate way of measuring the distance traveled by an immaterial entity. However, I do know that all measurements are to some degree arbitrary. The distance of a foot used to be based on the length of an actual human’s foot. The measurement of a second has changed with time and is now thought to be related to the decomposition of a Cesium atom. The pound is based on the weight of a particular object. These standards for measurement are chosen only for the purposes of making an identification, and could be changed (though not likely, or easily) based on human intentions. For example, if tomorrow, the governing bodies decided that a pound would not be more precisely or better measured by the weight of Gary Coleman on the day he was born (hypothetically), and Gary Coleman on the day he was born was 5lbs by current standards, then whatever you currently weigh would be divided by 5 and on your drivers license you would have to say that you were 30lbs (if you are currently 150).

With respect to millimeters and LOVE, I could create a new standard of measurement for the distance traveled by love. I could call it something like “emotes”, etc. However, I feel like that would be hard for a person to visualize and understand who is knew to Persuasion Alchemy. Although, the concept of love traveling any distance is hard to understand, I feel that it may be a tad easier to comprehend when we use an idea that is not compounded in complexity by abstraction. So, until a better system is devised (by me or others) to describe the distance love travels, this is what we will use.

What is LOVE in this case?
For the purposes of this thought experiment, love is treated as a material element, or object. I have thought about creating a periodic table of elements which consists of “substances” that cause humans to move. These may include: love, hate, fear, anger, sex; and are based on our primal urges as well as some higher level instincts. But I would like to save that for a different discussion. LOVE is like a piece of iron. If you project (I.e. throw or launch) it, it moves. If it hits something, that thing is impacted and may move. Depending on how fast, how far and how big the piece of iron is, the thing it impacts changes how it responds (moving, getting dented, getting hot or just staying there). This is also affected by the material the other object is made of. The same with LOVE. If you project it (I.e. set it in motion), it moves. You can set it in motion within yourself, but then it will only be affected within yourself, that is until you set it in motion outside of yourself by taking action. When you set it in motion outside of yourself, it impacts other people outside of yourself, can interact with other urges and motives. Depending on how it collides with other urges or motives, determines how it responds, as well as how the other urge or motive responds, and all of this impacts how the people involved respond.

What does it mean for LOVE to travel a distance of 8 millimeters?
LOVE traveling 8 mm is somewhat of an abstraction. We will talk more about what this means later, and to some degree I am not completely sure yet, and this work will be refined as we progress. Right now, it is just being used to measure LOVE’s movement, so that eventually we can track the forces acting on it in the same way. As I mentioned before, if LOVE is set in motion, speed is an important factor as it determines many things, including how hard it hits the other mass involved, point of collision, etc. All of this, in turn, determines how the impacted thing reacts. More on this to come. For now, let us move on to our next topic: acceleration and free fall.
